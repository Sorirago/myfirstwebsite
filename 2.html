<h2>World's Smallest Violin; 누구든 들어봤을 노래</h2>

My grandpa fought in World War II<br>
He was such a noble dude<br>
I can't even finish school<br>
Missed my mom and left too soon<br>
His dad was a fireman<br>
Who fought fires so violent<br>
I think I bored my therapist<br>
While playing him my violin<br>
(Oh my God) That's so insane<br>
(Oh my God) That's such a shame<br>
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand<br>
But I can't help myself from feeling bad<br>
I kinda feel like two things can be sad<br>
The world's smallest violin<br>
Really needs an audience<br>
So if I do not find somebody soon<br>
(That's right, that's right)<br>
I'll blow up into smithereens<br>
And spew my tiny symphony<br>
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you<br>
My grandpa fought in World War II<br>
He was such a noble dude<br>
Man, I feel like such a fool<br>
I got so much left to prove<br>
All my friends have vaping friends<br>
They're so good at making friеnds<br>
I'm so scared of caving in<br>
Is that entertaining yеt?<br>
(Oh my God) That's so insane
