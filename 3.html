<p>
I've been so good, I've been helpful and friendly<br>
I've been so good, why am I feeling empty?<br>
I've been so good, I've been so good this year<br>
I've been so good, but it's still getting harder<br>
I've been so good, where the hell is the <strong> karma </strong><br>
I've been so good, I've been so good this year<br></p>
<p style="margin-top:40px;"> Why, are you asking me why? <br>
My days and nights are filled with disappointment<br>
Fine, oh no, everything's fine<br>
I'm not sure why I booked today's appointment</p>
<p>I've been so good, I've been helpful and friendly<br>
I've been so good, why am I feeling empty?<br>
I've been so good, I've been so good this year<br>
I've been so good, but it's still getting harder<br>
I've been so good, where the hell is the <strong> karma </strong>?<br>
I've been so good, I've been so good this year<br></p>
<p>
What, am I normal or not?<br>
Am I crazier than other patients?<br>
Right,  <strong> I've done <u>everything</u> right </strong>I've done everything right<br>
So where's the karma doc, I've lost my patience<br>
'Cause I've been so good, I've been working my ass off... </p>
